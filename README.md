# Method 1 : OpenCore
Download OpenCore From Here
https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/download/0.7.5/OpenCore-0.7.5-RELEASE.zip

# Prerequisites
**[CRUCIAL]** Time and patience.
Don't start working on this if you have deadlines or important work. Hackintoshes are not something you should be relying on as a work machine.
# Making the installer in Windows
While you don't need a fresh install of macOS to use OpenCore, some users prefer having a fresh slate with their boot manager upgrades.

To start you'll need the following:

4GB USB Stick

For USB larger than 16 GB to format in FAT32

macrecovery.py

This will require Python installed

# Downloading macOS
To grab legacy installers is super easy, first grab a copy of OpenCorePkg (opens new window)and head to /Utilities/macrecovery/. Next copy the folder path for the macrecovery folder:
